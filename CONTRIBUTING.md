# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Please follow these guidelines to make collaboration smooth.

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main` named `feature/<short-desc>`.
2. Write clear, focused commits. Prefer small changes per PR.
3. Add tests for new functionality where applicable.
4. Open a pull request describing the change, the rationale, and any migration steps.
5. CI should run and pass before merging. Maintainers may request changes.

Code style: follow existing TypeScript conventions in `src/`.

If your change affects configuration, add documentation to `README.md` and update `.env.sample`.
