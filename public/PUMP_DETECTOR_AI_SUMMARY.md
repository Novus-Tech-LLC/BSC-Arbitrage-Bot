# 🚀 Pump Detector AI Integration Complete

## What I've Built

I've successfully incorporated the AI agent with DUST pump analysis skills into your trading bot. The system now includes:

### 1. **PumpDetectorAI Service** (`src/services/pumpDetectorAI.ts`)
- Detects 6 pump phases: Accumulation, Initial Pump, Peak FOMO, Distribution, Dump, Dead
- Analyzes volume for wash trading (like DUST's 2x volume/MC ratio)
- Assesses narrative strength and viral potential  
- Generates entry/exit recommendations
- Provides detailed warnings about manipulation

### 2. **Trading Bot Integration**
- Runs pump analysis on all trending tokens before making trades
- Only trades tokens that pass pump detection filters
- Skips tokens in distribution/dump phases
- Avoids extreme risk tokens
- Combines narrative score (40%) + pump score (40%) + market metrics (20%)

### 3. **Dashboard Enhancements**
- Shows pump phase with emojis (🚀, 💀, etc.) 
- Displays volume/MC ratio warnings
- Shows ENTRY/NO ENTRY recommendations
- Color-coded risk levels
- Real-time WebSocket updates

## Key Features Based on DUST Analysis

### Volume Analysis
```typescript
volumeThresholds: {
  normal: 0.5,        // Volume < 50% of MC
  suspicious: 1.0,    // Volume = 100% of MC  
  manipulation: 1.5,  // Volume > 150% of MC
  severe: 2.0        // Volume > 200% of MC (like DUST)
}
```

### Entry Rules
- ✅ ONLY enter in accumulation or initial pump phases
- ✅ Volume/MC ratio must be < 1.5x
- ✅ Risk level not EXTREME
- ✅ Narrative score high
- ❌ NEVER enter distribution, dump, or dead phases

### Risk Assessment
- **EXTREME**: Distribution phase OR volume > 2x MC
- **VERY HIGH**: Peak FOMO OR high manipulation
- **HIGH**: Low pump score OR volatility issues
- **MEDIUM**: Good entry in accumulation phase
- **LOW**: High liquidity + organic volume

## How It Works

1. **Bot scans BSC tokens** → Fetches trending memecoins
2. **Narrative AI analyzes** → Scores 0-100 based on story strength  
3. **Pump Detector analyzes** → Identifies phase and manipulation
4. **Combined scoring** → Only trades safe, high-potential tokens
5. **Dashboard shows all data** → Real-time pump phases and warnings

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/pump-analyses` - Get all pump analyses
- `POST /api/analyze-token/:address` - Analyze specific token

## Usage

Start the bot and it will automatically:
1. Detect pump patterns like DUST
2. Warn about wash trading
3. Only enter safe opportunities
4. Show detailed analysis in dashboard

The AI now has all the pump detection skills learned from analyzing DUST and other pump & dump schemes! 🎯
